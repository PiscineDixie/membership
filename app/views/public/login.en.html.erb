  This program is used by Dixie Pool members to update their membership information. New members can create their profile.
</p>

<h3>Existing members</h3>
<p>The emails that you receive from Dixie Pool include a link that gets you directly into
your profile. If your profile includes an email address, you can enter it below to obtain
immediately a new email with your personal link.
</p>

<%= form_tag :action => 'login' do %>
<p>
<b>Email address:</b>
<%= text_field_tag :courriel, params[:courriel], :size => 15 %>
</p>
<p>
  <%= submit_tag "Send email" %>
<% end %>

<p>
If we do not recognize your email address, you may create a new profile using the link below.

<h3>New membership</h3>
<p>
  If you were not a member last year, you have to create a family profile. This
  profile includes your address, the family members and their activities, etc.
  From this your membership fee is computed and emailed to you.

<%= link_to "Start my registration", {:action => "new", :controller => 'public'} %>
