  This program is used by Dixie Pool members to update their membership information. New members can create their profile.
</p>

<h3>Existing members</h3>
<p>The emails that you receive from Dixie Pool include a link that gets you directly into
your profile. If your profile includes an email address, you can enter it below to obtain
immediately a new email with your personal link.
</p>

<%= form_tag :action => 'login' do %>
  <div class="form-group">
   <label>Email address</label>
   <div class="row">
   <div class="col-xs-4 col-lg-2">
    <%= text_field_tag :courriel, params[:courriel], class: 'form-control' %>
   </div>
   </div>
  </div>
  <%= submit_tag "Send email",  class: 'btn btn-default'  %>
<% end %>

<h3>New membership</h3>
<p>
  If you were not a member last year, you have to create a family profile. This
  profile includes your address, the family members and their activities, etc.
  From this your membership fee is computed and emailed to you.

<%= button_to "Register", {:action => "new", :controller => 'public'}, {method: :get, class: 'btn btn-primary'} %>
